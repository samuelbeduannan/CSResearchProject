1. Used Pandas to read the data from CSV file
2. Used Pingouin Library to build the model for ANOVA
3. did work and showed that there are few groups of samples
   that are different. 
4. When performed post hoc tests, it did not work as our 
   dataset had so many 0's and 1's in them which makes x and 
   and y equal in most cases. So, the model did
   not compute the t and p-value. 
5. Hence, we decided to remove uncessary data from the dataset
   and use those feature that are contributing most in the 
   feature. If it will not work, we will use another library
   for implementation.
