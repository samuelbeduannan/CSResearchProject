1. Used Pandas to read the data from CSV file
2. Used Statsmodels Library to build the model for ANOVA
3. Worked perfectly, but it was comparing the two samples 
   at a time in one way ANOVA and we wanted to compare
   11 samples at a time to find the best features. 
4. We decided not to use this library as it did not work 
   the way we wanted to.
